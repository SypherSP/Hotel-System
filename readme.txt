Current State:
	As of now we have been successfull in implementing the basics of
	hotel side of the project. Some employee types still need to be 
	added and the billing system needs to be implemented. As for now 
	a very basic billing system exists.
	Currently the welcome class has has been designed to create only a
	single customer but all the other parts of the system is completely 
	capable of handling multiple of them.
